<h2>My Top 5 movies of all Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>K.G.F Chapter 1 & 2</h3>
<p>Both the parts of K.G.F are really amazing to watch.<br />Some of the scenes carry away emotionally.</p>
<h3>Pushpa Part 2:The Rule</h3>
<p>One of the best movies I've ever watched<br />It's a well tailored movie for actor like Allu Arjun.</p>
<h3>Khaleja</h3>
<p>Best movie to witness vintage Mahesh who is very free spirited.<br />Mahesh's charm adds to Trivikram's writing which resulted to be a Blockbuster.</p>
<h3>Baahubali</h3>
<p>This movie has set new standards in the field of Film making.<br />Everything in this movie is so perfectly blended that it turned out to to be a Magnum-Opus.</p>
<h3>Kantara</h3>
<p>We can say that this film has shaken the entire world.<br />Rishabh Shetty with his great acting and visionary direction took the film to next level.</p>
